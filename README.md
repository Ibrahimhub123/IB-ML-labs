# ðŸ”¬ Machine Learning Lab Overview â€“ Spring 2025
Welcome to the Machine Learning Lab repository for Spring 2025. This lab series is part of the undergraduate curriculum in Electrical Engineering and aims to bridge theory and practice in modern machine learning.

Through a progressive set of assignments, students develop a deep understanding of core ML concepts, from data preprocessing and classical models to deep learning architectures such as CNNs, RNNs, LSTMs, and state-of-the-art models like GoogLeNet. Each lab is implemented in Python using libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and Keras.

The labs emphasize real-world application, hands-on experimentation, and code modularityâ€”preparing students to tackle complex problems in data science, AI, and signal processing domains.

## ðŸ§ª Lab Overview

Below is a structured summary of all ML labs from Lab 1 to the Open-Ended. Each lab progressively builds foundational skills in data preprocessing, neural networks, and advanced architectures.
